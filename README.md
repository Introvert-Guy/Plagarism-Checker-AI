Plagiarism Checker AI
Using Sentence-BERT Embeddings & Logistic Regression

Project Overview
This project detects plagiarism by comparing the semantic similarity of sentence pairs. It uses sentence embeddings generated by Sentence-BERT and trains a Logistic Regression model to classify whether the sentences are plagiarized or not.

Dataset
The model is trained on the MIT Plagiarism Detection Dataset, which contains labeled sentence pairs indicating whether they are similar or not.

Model & Features
Sentence embeddings are generated using the Sentence-BERT model. Features include the absolute difference and element-wise multiplication of the embedding vectors. A Logistic Regression classifier is trained on these features to detect similarity.

Demonstration
Users can input two sentences to check for plagiarism. The model predicts whether plagiarism is detected along with a similarity confidence score.
